Often, the first post of a new blog has to explain the purpose, the reason why one starts to write something entirely new. Sometimes, the reason just urges and grows from the bottom of your deepest desires.

Some years ago I owned a personal website on lightningspirit.net domain, filled up with some crazy and "unimportant" stuff even with thoughts that nowadays would make me blush... whatever!

I used to write things about my daily activities, coding, web development, music, etc, and, when I remember those days, I recall how enjoyable it was to write something and get it published right away at the same day.

On the other hand, owning a blog is like having your very own virtual space, a unique piece of your fine art and your thoughts. There's no "buzzing", no "home feed", no "profile page", nothing that would make it spoil your words with fragments of existentialism.

I believe, this is the best reason I can provide for now.

This summer me and my lovely one, we spent over 2 weeks in some Azores Islands, in the middle of Atlantic Ocean. *Terrific* is the word I use to describe this experience. A naturally harvested paradise, an archipelago of 8 islands mixing naturally crafted landscapes where one can hike towards small villages 20 minutes away from central towns.

Azores was [allegedly first dicovered by Diogo de Silves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Azores) in 1415. He was the one who discovered the most eastern cluster. Afterwards, some other discoveries took place during that century. One of the most convincing is *Sao Jorge* island.

Faial Island is where most of the trans-atlantic ships take a nap.
