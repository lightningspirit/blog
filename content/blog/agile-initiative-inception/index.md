Do you remember the kick-off day for the initiative you're currently involved?

What about the first meetings where everyone was super excited and in agreement?

That general positive spreading throughout the room, that lovely shiny feeling
of a new thing to develop. How awesome was that, right?

Now, take a step back and look where you are today.
Do you feel the same way?

Yes? No?

**There's a strong probability that you're not feeling well** with all the struggling,
deadlines, misunderstandings on basic concepts, dealignment. Is that so?

Well, that happens a lot. I'd even say every time, and there's a reason
why that happens: it's because that you, your teammates, your Product Owner, your Engineering Manager
and even all stakeholders are different people, each one with they're own baggage, conceptions, and agreement on
what to develop.

> You, your teammates, your Product Owner, your Engineering Manager
and even all stakeholders are different people

You're not aligned with each other, conceptually.

I mean, it's not about you or the Team Lead of the Product not being able to understand or make it clear to everyone.
The reason is **without proper common ground rules and fundamental processes that's what you'll get on big projects.**

You're not able to conceive strategy for big things all along, sometimes you're not even able to have good previsions
on what you're going to deliver tomorrow by EOD - it's human nature, and that's fine! The truth is: it's all about prevision.

> The truth is: it's all about prevision

The human brain is capable of calculating [20 million billion bits of information per second](http://thephenomenalexperience.com/content/how-fast-is-your-brain/) 
only spending [20 Watts](https://www.munichre.com/topics-online/en/digitalisation/interview-henning-beck.html) on average.
That's astonishingly fast! However, that only works on simple daily activities.

**So, is there anything we can do to improve prevision?**
**Wouldn't it be lovely to have a better knowledge of what's the real deal when developing a new feature?**

I believe so, and I think *Agile* practices, namely *Scrum* methodology, might be a truth strength beneath it.

But wait, isn't *Agile* about small deliverables and consistent pacing without worrying too much on the big picture?
In part, it is a bit, but it is also about **great communication**, **better acknowledgment**, **forecasting**, and **collaboration**.

## Welcome to the *Agile Initiative Inception*

The only purpose of running a session of *Agile Initiative Inception* is that everyone is aligned and understand the initiative,
and that's it, nothing more, nothing less!

> Everyone is aligned and understand the initiative

## Shift your mindset

To successfully run an *Agile Initiative Inception* you first need the change how
you, your team and all intervenients think about why it is important to find
common knowledge.

The following image is a good way to represent what we want to achieve:

![](./agreement-then.png)

*Picture borrowed from [Agile Warrior](https://agilewarrior.wordpress.com/2010/11/06/the-agile-inception-deck/)*

One way to do it is to **work with all intervenients from the very beginning** envolving
them even before this session and to clearly **define your problem first**.

If you don' know each other, drink a coffee together, share your ideas and ask for
their feedback.

## Start from the beginning

Sit everyone together, **define a social contract** regarding equipment you can use and
how to leave the room without interruption, breaks, etc.

Start by presenting an **Agenda** and what are the **expectations for the session**.
The following is an example of such:

- Understand the initiative **motivations**
- Find your **common ground** and understand the goals
- Raise **questions**, doubts and close previous open questions
- Assess **risks**, impediments and dependencies
- Discover the **direction**, what is in the scope and out-of-scope
- What are the **next steps**? Create action points.


## Start with a “Why?”

#### Duration: 10 minutes

Generally, what you want to achieve is a set of goals that define a
vision for the project, which means you can **reduce it to a sentence**.

All intervenients need to understand who are the stakeholders
and the reason behind the initiative.

## Scope, out of scope, unresolved

#### Duration: 30-90 minutes

Once the **vision** is defined, you advance to the next step in this process where
you write down in a **big whiteboard** or by using **post-its** what is in the scope and
what it is not:

![](./scope-out-of-scope-unresolved.png)

After running this step, you'll come with some barriers about what you want to tackle 
and what is out of the scope.

## Meet your neighbors

#### Duration: 30-60 minutes

Now it's time to **identify dependencies** or points of contact. For each item/topic 
on scope, know which **teams need to be involved** and what external dependencies
need to be resolved.

Keep in mind that this is only a high-level overview as the details for each item/topic
should be aligned in different sessions, such as a *User Story Mapping*.

## Show your solution

#### Duration: 60-90 minutes

Using the big whiteboard, rearrange your scope and draw your *boxes* involving everyone
and try to include some technical details in it (but nothing elaborated).

Divide the team into **small task groups** and draw some architectural diagrams taking into account:
- **Existing ecosystem** that might be affected
- Describe what needs to be changed
- Understand the **implications** of such changes
- Drive the discussion to the outcome

Optionally you can decide to do a quick presentation about each part of the
architectural diagram and make sure everyone understands what role each component
plays in the existing ecosystem.

## What keeps us up at night?

#### Duration: 30-60 minutes

One thing most of the times we forget to discuss is to assess risks we can face on
short and long-term during all the initiative lifecycle: from development to general availability.

Start by mapping the **risks** and drive the discussion for each one to conclude
if they **worth tackling or not** - be conservative in this phase. The recommended maximum time
for each topic is about 10 minutes of discussion.

Last but not least, take out the *Unresolved* ideas and drive discussions for each one
like you did for the ones within *Scope*.

If you can't find an agreement, place that item in a *Parking Lot* for further discussion
in a different forum and move on to the next one.

## User Story Mapping

Now with all the work we did before, we're prepared to run one or more *[User Story Mapping](https://app.mindsettlers.com/guide/6y2yApgsr6gy2MY0mSQ8U6)* sessions
where the Product scope is clear, and everyone is ready to deep dive into the user journeys.

## Conclusions

The described methodology is a high-level framework to involve everyone during the Product design phase.
Whenever you feel you need to find common ground, you should run it.

I think this tool can help teams to define a vision, scope
and requirements of an initiative for the next steps and unblock some inconsistencies
and miscommunication that sometimes appears during development phases.
