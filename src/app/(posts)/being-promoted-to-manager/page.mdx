# Being promoted to engineering manager

I just got promoted to engineering manager.

Getting promoted to a manager position is definitely a high point in anyone's career. The focus shifts from purely technical to leading and managing people. Challenges exist in this kind of transition, though, usually in the form of anxious feelings regarding how one is going to manage former colleagues who are now direct reports.

## Dealing with Anxiety

It is natural to feel a little scared by the new role. You are probably thinking, _Do I have what it takes in leadership skills?_ _Will my colleagues respect me in this new role?_ Recognize the feelings, but remember that they are quite common and temporary. Again, recognize your strengths and where your organization has placed its confidence by promoting you.

## Developing Relationships

This transition from peers to leader requires a delicate balancing act of authority and empathy. First, open the channels of communication. This can be done with one-on-one meetings where expectations are shared and time allowed for them to discuss their concerns regarding your new role as manager. Be open to change in the relationship with them but still maintain respect for their experience.

## Clearly Define Expectations

As a manager, clarity is your best friend. Right from the outset, spell out roles, responsibilities, and performance standards clearly. Then explain to them your vision for the team and bring their goals in line with the objectives of the organization. It creates accountability and gives rise to a feeling of common purpose amongst your team members.

## Developing Leadership Skills

The move into a management position will require skills one might not have. Seek mentorship from either experienced managers within or outside your organization. Take time to learn about leadership styles, conflict resolution, and communication skills. Stay open to feedback and continue making improvements as you grow into your new role.

## Overcoming Obstacles

Challenges are part of any managerial job. Handle conflicts in a solution-oriented way, not blame-oriented. Develop a culture in your team based on trust and cooperation.
