This article covers how to redirect all requests from `my-app.herokuapp.com`
to another address, like `my-app.github.io` or `my-app.com`.

The same approach can be used in other situations where you need a permanent redirect to maintain consistency with previous URLs.

We faced this challenge when planning to migrate some apps from Heroku to our own Kubernetes instance.

These apps also had a custom domain configured, so we needed to redirect all incoming requests to the new domain pointing to our Kubernetes cluster.

To do this, I created a small Node.js app that responds to every request with an `HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently` status, keeping the path structure intact.

We monitored the Heroku instance for a few months and saw a gradual decrease in requests over the first few days, eventually reaching zero in the last 30 days. After that, we shut it down and completed the migration.

## How to use?

**It's all done in four simple steps.**

The source code is available in [this Github repository](https://github.com/lightningspirit/permanent-redirect-server)
and you can use it for your own purposes.

The codebase is a simple Node.js app that creates an HTTP server and handles a raw HTTP response using the native  `http.createServer` method.

It also includes a `Procfile`, which will be activated as soon as it’s deployed to Heroku.

### Steps
#### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the repository and configure the Heroku git remote to push:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lightningspirit/permanent-redirect-server.git
```
```bash
$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/my-app.git
```

#### 2. Run the tests

Make sure you'll run the automated tests before using this for real.
```bash
$ npm test
```

If anything went wrong in this part, you should not proceed but [file an issue](https://github.com/lightningspirit/permanent-redirect-server/issues) in the repository.

#### 3. Configure the address to redirect

Now, you need to tell the script where to redirect all new requests by adding
a new environmental variable to the container:

```bash
$ heroku config:set NEW_BASE_URL=https://my-app.com -a my-app
Setting NEW_BASE_URL and restarting ⬢ my-app... done, vX
NEW_BASE_URL: https://my-app.com
```

All set! Now we just need to deploy it.

#### 4. Zero-downtime deployment

Heroku's deployment strategy aims to minimize downtime when uploading a new version. **The existing containers are only removed once the new one is ready and all current requests are completed.**

There's even a pre-boot option for apps that need to warm up their content, but for this case, you can ignore it.

Before taking this step, make sure **the new instance is properly working and can handle the traffic shift** from Heroku.

So, let's deploy it:
```bash
$ git push heroku master
```

Wait for the build process to finish, and test it:

```bash
$ curl http://my-app.herokuapp.com/foo/bar?param=value -v
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< Location: http://my-app.com/foo/bar?param=value
```

And that's it! From now on, all requests will be redirected to the new instance.
