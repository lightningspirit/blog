As a technical interviewer at Talkdesk, I've had the chance to meet a lot of interesting people over the past two years. Most were very technical, others less so, but all of them seemed professional and talented &mdash; it's fantastic to work in an industry where you encounter so many fascinating people!

One interesting thing I've noticed is when we ask candidates, *What's the main difference between POST and PUT verbs?* 99% of the answers are along the lines of *POST is for creating things, PUT for updating*.

### What are the origins of this idea?

According to the HTTP/1.1 Spec:

> The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line.

In other words, that means the client is telling to **create** a new representation of the identified resource.

> The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server.

In this case, when I want to **update** an identity, I should use this verb.

Cool, so we reached to the traditional idea of **creating** versus **updating**.


### Some examples to exercise

Let's imagine there's a `people` resource. We're going to perform some operations.

1. Let's create one person:
```json
> POST /people
{
  "name": "Vitor Carvalho",
  "currency": "EUR"
}
```
```json
< Location: /people/1
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Vitor Carvalho",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "credit": "0.00"
}
```
Great! A person was created.

2. Let's update it's content:
```json
> PUT /people/1
{
  "name": "Vitor de Carvalho",
  "currency": "USD",
  "credit": "10.00"
}
```
```json
< Location: /people/1
{
  "id": "1",
  "name": "Vitor de  Carvalho",
  "currency": "USD",
  "credit": "10.00"
}
```

3. Let's give this person some more credit:
```json
> POST /people/1/credit
{
  "amount": "2.00"
}
```

In the last example, POST was used to add credit.
Since the `credit` property already exists, **why not use PUT instead?**

### Enters Idempotence

[Idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) ensures that even if an action is performed multiple times with the same input, the result remains unchanged. In simpler terms, repeating the action doesn't cause additional effects.

According to section 9.1.2 of [RFC2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html):

> Methods can also have the property of "idempotence" in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property.

This means **PUT** should always be idempotent. However, adding credit with an amount isn't idempotent; it always adds to the current value (handled atomically on the backend), which violates the idempotence principle of **PUT**.

### Conclusions

**PUT** is inherently **idempotent**, highlighting the main difference between POST and PUT and explaining why POST is used for creating a new representation.

### TL;DR

- For actions without needing idempotence, use **POST**
- For actions requiring idempotence, prefer **PUT** (or **POST** when **PUT** is not feasible)

#### Examples:
- Creating a new instance of a resource `POST /people`
- Perform actions to existing resources `POST /people/1/credits`
- Updating a representation `PUT /people/1`, `PUT /people/1/avatar`
- Perform idempotent actions `PUT /settings` or `POST /settings`

Following this convention helps API designers signal whether an operation supports idempotence, which can prevent headaches in production.
