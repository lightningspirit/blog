So, I just tried setting up login via public key on a new server and ran into the following error:

```bash
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS sent
debug1: expecting SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS
debug1: SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS received
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_REQUEST sent
debug1: SSH2_MSG_SERVICE_ACCEPT received
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/lightningspirit/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password
debug1: Next authentication method: password
```

What the hell?!

That wasn't helpful at all. Was my SSH config messed up? The client first tried public key authentication, but it was skipped.

After some time digging around, I finally figured out the issue: **bad permissions in the .ssh directory**.

Turns out, SSH doesn't like it when your home directory `~/` or `~/.ssh` directory have group write permissions. And honestly, that makes total sense to me as your home directory should only be writable by you, right?

So, I ran `chmod 700 ~/.ssh` and `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`  to fix the permissions.

There are other ways to solve this _issue_, such as disabling this *strict mode* (which I definitely wouldn't recommend at all).
